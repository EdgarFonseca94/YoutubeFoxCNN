# Fox and CNN Youtube Analysis

Background
------------------------
I really enjoy politics and understand that topics can be super controversial and media networks fuel this controversy. I wanted to analyze the channels of Fox News and CNN and their video postings to determine what topics their sharing with their viewers. I also want to observe the networks user engagement.

Data Collection
------------------------
The data was collected using Youtube's API where I pulled information about number of views, comments, likes, and also the title & description. The information was for 1000 of the latest videos from Fox News channel and 1000 from CNN channel.
